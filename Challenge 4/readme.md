# **Challenge 4 : The Deep Storage Inventory Search**

You are a Software Engineer at a massive automated warehouse. The warehouse stores crates in a square grid (`n x n`).

- **The Sorting:** To save time, the warehouse robots always keep crates sorted: they get heavier as you move **Right** and heavier as you move **Down**.
- **The Mission:** Your manager needs the **$k^{th}$ lightest crate** in the entire warehouse to fulfill a priority order.

### **The Technical Hurdle**

You could pull all the crates out and sort them in a long line, but that takes too much memory (O(n^2)). The warehouse computer is old—it needs a solution with **better memory efficiency**.

### What You Need to Do

Given an `n x n` matrix where:

- Each row is sorted in ascending order
- Each column is sorted in ascending order

Return the **kᵗʰ smallest element** in the matrix.

---

### Function Requirement

> Write a function that takes a 2D integer matrix matrix and an integer k, and returns the kᵗʰ smallest element.

### **Example Case**

- **Input:** `matrix = [[1, 5, 9], [10, 11, 13], [12, 13, 15]], k = 8`
- **Sorted List view:** `[1, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 15]`
- **8th Smallest:** `13`

- **Guide: Two Ways to Solve It**
    
    ### **Approach A: The "Priority Queue" (The Multi-Line Merge)**
    
    Think of each row as a sorted line of students. You want to find the kth smallest overall.
    
    1. Take the first element of every row and put it in a **Min-Heap**.
    2. Pop the smallest element.
    3. Replace it with the *next* element from the same row.
    4. Repeat k times. The kth element you pop is your winner!
    - **Efficiency:** O(k log n) time and O(n) space.
    
    ### **Approach B: The "Binary Search" (The Guess & Check)**
    
    This is the "Boss Level" solution for the follow-up. Instead of searching positions, we search the **Value Range**.
    
    1. **Low:** The lightest crate (top-left).
    2. **High:** The heaviest crate (bottom-right).
    3. **The Guess:** Pick a middle weight (`mid`).
    4. **The Count:** Use a "Staircase Search" to quickly count how many crates in the warehouse are lighter than `mid`. Because the rows/columns are sorted, you can do this count in O(n) time by starting at the bottom-left and moving up or right!
    5. **Adjust:** If the count is too low, your `mid` was too small. If too high, your `mid` was too big.
