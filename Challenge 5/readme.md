# Challenge 5: *Fix the Broken Expression*

---

You are given a string `expr` containing:

- lowercase letters
- parentheses `'('` and `')'`

Some parentheses may be **misplaced**.

A string is valid if every opening `'('` has a matching closing `')'` in the correct order.
Your task is to remove the **minimum number of parentheses** so that the resulting string is **valid**.

Return **all unique valid strings** that can be formed with the **minimum removals**.

You may return the answers in **any order**.

## Function Requirement

> Write a function that takes a string expr and returns a list of all valid strings with minimum removals.

- Examples
    
    ```
    Input:  "()())()"
    Output: ["(())()", "()()()"]
    
    Input:  "(a)())()"
    Output: ["(a())()", "(a)()()"]
    
    ****`Input:  ")("
    Output: [""]`
    
    Input:  "()"
    Output: ["()"]
    
    Input:  "abc"
    Output: ["abc"]
    
    Input:  "((("
    Output: [""]
    ```
    

---

- Constraints
    - `1 ≤ length of expr ≤ 25`
    - At most **20 parentheses**
    - Letters must remain unchanged

---

- Hint
    
    First, count how many `'('` and `')'` must be removed
    
    Then try removing parentheses step by step while keeping the string valid, and stop once minimum removals are reached.
    
    Avoid duplicate result
