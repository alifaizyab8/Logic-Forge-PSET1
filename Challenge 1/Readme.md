# Challenge 1: *Team Contribution Multiplier*

You are part of a **software engineering team** working on a **group project**.

Each team member contributes a **performance score** (could be positive, negative, or zero — just like real life 😄).

Your task is to **analyze impact**.

For every team member, calculate the **overall team performance if that member takes a break**.

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement (Student-Friendly)

You are given an integer array `contributions`, where:

- `contributions[i]` represents the **contribution score** of the `i-th` team member.

Create a new array `impact` such that:

> impact[i] is the product of all contribution scores except contributions[i].
> 

## Function Signature Requirement

Write a function that takes an integer array `contributions` and returns an integer array `impact`, where each element represents the product of all elements except itself.

- **Rules from the Team Lead**
    - You are **NOT allowed to use division** ❌
    - Your solution must run in **linear time** → **O(n)**
    - Extra space should be minimal
    - The result always fits within a **32-bit integer**

- Examples
    
    ### Example 1
    
    ```
    Input: contributions = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    Output: impact = [24, 12, 8, 6]
    ```
    
    👉 If member `0` steps away, the team impact is `2 × 3 × 4 = 24`
    
    ---
    
    ### Example 2
    
    ```
    Input: contributions = [-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]
    Output: impact = [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
    ```
    
    👉 A single `0` contribution affects the whole team — just like missing deadlines 😬

- Think Like an Engineer
    
    Instead of recalculating everything again and again:
    
    - First, compute **everything to the left** of each index
    - Then, compute **everything to the right**
    - Multiply both values to get the final impact
    
    ➡️ This can be done in **two clean passes** over the array.

- Bonus Challenge (For Curious Minds)
    
    💡 **Can you solve this using O(1) extra space?**
    
    > The output array does not count as extra space.
